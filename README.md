# Random Countries

This is a hobby project with the goal of randomly generating countries at the push of a button using the RestCountries API. This came out of a situation where some friends and I organized theme nights where we chose a country each time. Instead of using ChatGPT to generate these countries, I thought... Let me give it a try myself.

A nice next step would be to store the chosen countries in a database. Right now a unique country is already chosen each time, but of course this is not stored if you refresh the page.

At this point, you can press the button again after clicking the button. This is to show that a unique country is chosen each time.

The project is build using Vite and written in Handlebars, SCSS and vanilla Javascript.
